## About this site

This blog is built using Hugo, a fast and flexible static site generator, with the minimal xmin theme. The entire site was created and configured using Claude Code, Anthropic's AI-powered development assistant. From setting up the initial Hugo installation to customizing the theme and creating content, Claude Code was used to do all the configuration and demonstrate the power of AI-assisted web development.
