# About Andrew Moores

Welcome to my blog! I'm Andrew Moores, and this is where I share my thoughts on technology, development, and various tools that help make work more efficient.

## What You'll Find Here

I write about:

- Software development tools and workflows
- Productivity applications
- AI Tools including [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)
- [Domain Driven Design](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainDrivenDesign.html)
- Designing, building, testing and mocking APIs using [OpenAPI specs](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html)

## Background

I am a software engineer who has been programming for 35 years, currently in Java, TypeScript, and Python.

You can find my code and projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/asmoores).

## About this site

This blog is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a fast and flexible static site generator, with the minimal [xmin theme](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin). The entire site was created and configured using [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), Anthropic's AI-powered development assistant. From setting up the initial Hugo installation to customizing the theme and creating content, Claude Code was used to do all the configuration and demonstrate the power of AI-assisted web development.
